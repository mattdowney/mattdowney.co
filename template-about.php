		<h3 class="section-title">About Me</h3>
	 
		<p class="about-text-intro">My journey into web design began in 2004. I had just graduated from <a href="http://gsu.edu">Georgia State University</a> with a Bachelor's Degree in Marketing and took a job that would move me across the country from ATL to PDX.</p>

		<p>While working in the Pacific Northwest, I was thrown in to the most creative and energizing environment I had ever experienced. I was surrounded by smart people, innovative ideas, and tons of new technology.</p> 

		<p>It was during that time that I was introduced to web design and inspired to enroll in multimedia classes at <a href="http://psu.edu">Portland State University</a>. After earning my certificate, I took my newly acquired skills back to Atlanta to start <a href="http://45royale.com" title="45royale">45royale</a>.</p>

		<p>Now, with over a decade of experience in the web design and development space, I’m happy to offer my expertise to those in need. If you have a question or would like to chat about working together, please feel free to <a href="<?php bloginfo('wpurl'); ?>/contact">contact me</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/mattdowney">hit me up on Twitter</a>.️</p>
